// It is a basic syntac of Java
// ✅ String[] args vs String args[]
// Both are valid in Java and mean the same thing:
// They both declare an array of Strings named args.

// 🔍 The only difference is style/placement:
// Syntax	Meaning ===
// String[] args	=== Preferred style in Java (type is clearly an array of String)
// String args[]	=== Also valid, inherited from C/C++ style (type is still String[])
